# SSOT VIOLATION AUDIT: QOLAE-CaseManagers-Dashboard

**Date:** 3rd December 2025
**Auditor:** Claude Code
**Status:** CLEAN - No violations in active code

---

## ARCHITECTURE RULE

**Parent Bridge dashboards must NEVER query database directly.**
All data access must go through SSOT API (`api.qolae.com`) via `fetch()`.

---

## AUDIT RESULT

**NO `pool.query` violations found in active source code.**

Note: `pool.query` references were found in `/docs/CM-README.md` (documentation only), not in executable code.

This dashboard correctly follows SSOT architecture:
- All database access goes through SSOT API
- No direct database queries in route handlers
- Clean separation of concerns

---

## DOCUMENTATION NOTE

The file `docs/CM-README.md` contains example code snippets with `pool.query`. These are documentation examples, not violations. However, the documentation should be updated to show the correct SSOT pattern:

**Current (in docs):**
```javascript
await pool.query(...)  // WRONG pattern shown in docs
```

**Should show:**
```javascript
await fetch(`${SSOT_BASE_URL}/api/...`)  // Correct SSOT pattern
```

---

## STATUS

**COMPLIANT** - Active code is clean.
**RECOMMENDATION** - Update documentation to show correct SSOT patterns.
