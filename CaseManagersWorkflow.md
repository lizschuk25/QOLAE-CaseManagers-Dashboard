Liz’s & Case Managers’ Workflow
1. Liz reaches out to Law Firms through the Web, Telephone or email. MARKETING/
OUTREACH

2. Liz fills out the Lawyers Registration card on the QOLAE Admin Portal. The fields
are: Law Firm Name, Contact, email and telephone number, which, once entered,
trigger a PIN Number which is autogenerated and added to the Lawyers Tracking
Database. Buttons added from this first card to call up the Lawyers Tracking
Database (LTDb).

3.There are Status updates, initial contact date, follow up fields, next steps, notes and a document repository for Liz’s CV, Addenda and Terms of Business. Etc. within this
LTDb.

4.Once the Lawyers email Liz to request for her CV and Terms of Business, this sets
Liz’s Workflow in motion.

5.The tick box within the Lawyers Tracking Database generates a clickable pin in the
footer of the title page of the TOB and on page 20 of the TOB, as well as populating
the name of the Law firm in the title page and the signature placeholders and
changing the pin number within the Introductory email letter to a clickable/hyperlink
format.

6.The CV, TOB and Case Studies along with an Introductory letter are sent to the Law
firm once the ‘Send documents’ box is ticked.

7.Liz uses the LTDb to follow up as necessary.

8.When the Lawyers decide to engage Liz & QOLAE, then they click on the link and
commence their Lawyer’s workflow. They sign the TOB document and make a payment and at this point the system allocates the CM by sending Liz/other a notification, which she must select. 

9.Liz is sent a notification as soon as payment is made on the portal.

10.Once the Lawyer enters, the client details into the Consent form, Liz has access to
the client’s data that auto populates the INA Referral (Case Referral & Instructions on the Lawyers Dashboard), the INA form, the INA Checklist and the INA report.

11.Liz immediately calls the Client (Service User/Patient) to introduce herself and field any questions or concerns about the Consent form. She provisionally books an INA
visit appointment with the client/Patient in her calendar.

12.Liz will have entered the details on the Readers portal/workspace and once Consent
has been sent off, she will tick the box that autogenerates a reader specific PIN
no and emailed to the Readers. NOTE THAT READER WORKFLOW IS SEPARATE. NDA will be available for signing digitally on the portal for the Readers once they log on to the system and have gone through the 2 way FA authentication system. Liz's automatic signature will also be applied.

**Option A - Phone Reference (Preferred):**
1. Liz calls the referee
2. Liz fills out `reference-form.ejs` with referee's answers during the call
3. System automatically emails the **pre-filled** form to referee for review and digital signature
4. Referee receives email → reviews pre-filled form (takes 30 seconds) → signs digitally → submits
5. Signed reference is saved to `qolae_hrcompliance` database
6. Liz receives notification: "Reference received from [Referee Name]"

3. Referee fills out entire form themselves and signs digitally
4. Signed reference is saved to `qolae_hrcompliance` database
5. Liz receives notification: "Reference received from [Referee Name]"

**Step 3: Final Approval**
- Once **both references** are received and signed

- Actions triggered:
  - Compliance record is **locked** in `qolae_hrcompliance` database (audit-ready)
  - Reader's account is fully activated
  - Reader receives email: "Your compliance has been approved. You can now access your dashboard."
- Status updates to: "[Reader Name] - Compliance Approved ✓"

**Database & Security:**
